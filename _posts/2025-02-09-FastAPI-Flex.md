# FastAPI-Flex Design Document

## 0. Introduction
I recently became interested in learning how to write Google design docs. I figured I'd give it a shot and write one about a FastAPI library I recently created. Without further ado, let's get into it. 

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Project Name
FastAPI-Flex

### 1.2 Project Description
FastAPI-Flex is a template library designed to streamline the development of FastAPI projects by incorporating principles of efficient state management, performance optimization, flexibility, and seamless integration. This library aims to provide developers with a robust foundation for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable FastAPI applications.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals
- Provide efficient state management for FastAPI applications.
- Optimize performance using asynchronous processing and caching strategies.
- Ensure flexibility through modular architecture and middleware support.
- Facilitate seamless integration with real-time communication and third-party libraries.

### 2.2 Non-Goals
- This library will not cover database-specific optimizations.
- It will not include advanced machine learning or AI functionalities.

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Efficient State Management
- Utilize dependency injection to manage state efficiently.
- Implement context management for handling resources like database connections.

### 3.2 Performance Optimization
- Leverage asynchronous processing to improve performance.
- Implement caching strategies to reduce redundant computations.

### 3.3 Flexibility
- Design a modular architecture for independent development and maintenance.
- Use middleware to add cross-cutting concerns without modifying core logic.

### 3.4 Seamless Integration
- Support WebSockets for real-time communication.
- Ensure compatibility with a variety of third-party libraries and tools.
